claude "You are the Lead Developer. Read .prompts/lead.md for your FULL role instructions — especially the CRITICAL Continuous Operation Mode section. Then read dev_agent.md and CLAUDE.md. You must work continuously through Phase 1 Weeks 1-3: check team status, merge ready branches, run tests, assign next tasks. NEVER stop after one task — keep the loop going until Phase 1 is complete. Start by checking .coordination/status-partA.md and status-partB.md for current progress, then merge and coordinate."
